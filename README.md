This project demonstrates the application of the T5 model (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) for text summarization using the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The goal of this project is to generate concise summaries of long-form articles while preserving key information.

Project Overview
The model used in this project is T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer), a pre-trained model developed by Google for a variety of natural language processing tasks, including summarization. In this implementation, the T5 model is fine-tuned to generate summaries for news articles from the CNN/Daily Mail dataset.

Key Features:
T5-based model for generating text summaries.

ROUGE metric for evaluating summary quality.

Utilizes the CNN/Daily Mail dataset for training and evaluation.

The model outputs summaries in a concise and readable format.

Technologies Used
Transformers Library (Hugging Face): For accessing pre-trained models and tokenizers.

Datasets Library (Hugging Face): For easy access to the CNN/Daily Mail dataset.

ROUGE Evaluation Metric: To evaluate the quality of generated summaries.

Installation
To get started with the project, you need to install the required libraries. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install datasets
pip install transformers
pip install evaluate
How to Use
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-summarization-t5.git
cd text-summarization-t5
Run the Script: You can run the script to generate summaries from the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The script will automatically download the dataset and generate summaries for a selected article.

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, T5Tokenizer
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load dataset
ds = load_dataset("abisee/cnn_dailymail", "3.0.0")

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-base")
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-base")

# Select an article
article = ds['train'][0]['article']

# Tokenize input article
inputs = tokenizer(article, return_tensors="pt", max_length=2048, truncation=True, padding="max_length")

# Generate summary
summary_ids = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_length=150, min_length=40, length_penalty=5.0, num_beams=2)

# Decode summary
summary = tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(summary)
Evaluate the Model: To evaluate the model's summary generation performance, the ROUGE metric is used to compare the generated summaries with the ground truth summaries.

python
Copy
Edit
import evaluate

# Load ROUGE metric
rouge = evaluate.load("rouge")

def compute_metrics(pred):
    predictions, labels = pred
    decoded_preds = tokenizer.batch_decode(predictions, skip_special_tokens=True)
    labels = [[(l if l != -100 else tokenizer.pad_token_id) for l in label] for label in labels]
    decoded_labels = tokenizer.batch_decode(labels, skip_special_tokens=True)

    # Compute ROUGE scores
    result = rouge.compute(predictions=decoded_preds, references=decoded_labels, use_stemmer=True)

    # Return ROUGE1, ROUGE2, and ROUGEL scores
    return {
        "rouge1": result["rouge1"],
        "rouge2": result["rouge2"],
        "rougeL": result["rougeL"]
    }
Evaluation
The quality of the generated summaries is evaluated using the ROUGE metric, which compares the overlap between the generated summary and the reference (human-written) summary.

ROUGE-1: Measures the overlap of unigrams (individual words) between the predicted and reference summaries.

ROUGE-2: Measures the overlap of bigrams (pairs of words) between the predicted and reference summaries.

ROUGE-L: Measures the longest common subsequence between the predicted and reference summaries.

Contributions
Text Summarization: This project provides a simple yet effective approach to summarize articles automatically using the T5 model.

Open Source: Feel free to clone, fork, and contribute to the repository.

Future Enhancements
Fine-tuning the model for specific domains (e.g., scientific articles, legal documents).

Adding support for abstractive and extractive summary generation.

Implementing interactive web interfaces for real-time summarization.
